## Question
Develop a Java language programming regarding a vaccination program in Malaysia as follows. The implementation of Inheritance (Chapter 6) and Polymorphism (Chapter 7) concepts is highly recommended but not compulsory. Your creativity is worthwhile!
1)	Ask the user to state his/her name and the identification card (IC) number as stated in MyKad. (Marks 5)

2)	Ask the user whether the person has already been vaccinated (at least first dose) or not. (Marks 5)

3)	If the user is already vaccinated, ask the user whether there is any symptom that happened. If yes, ask the user to consult a doctor at the nearest time. Please state his/her name and MyKad in the output as follows:
“Dear Ahmad Afif Bin Ahmarofi (89xxxx02xxxx), You have a symptom. Please consult a doctor very soon. Thank you.” (Marks 10)

4)	If the user not experiencing any symptom, congratulate the user as follows:
“Dear Ahmad Afif Bin Ahmarofi (89xxxx02xxxx), congratulation. You have been vaccinated. Thank you.” (Marks 10)

5)	If the user is not vaccinated yet, ask the user whether the user already registered in the MySejahtera application. If yes, ask the user to patiently wait for his/her turn as follows:
“Dear Ahmad Afif Bin Ahmarofi (89xxxx02xxxx), kindly wait your turn to be vaccinated. Thank you.” (Marks 20)

6)	If the user is not registered yet, ask the user to state the reason for not registering yet. Then, ask the user to state his/her contact number. The output should be as follows:
“Dear Ahmad Afif Bin Ahmarofi (89xxxx02xxxx), your reason for not registering yet in MySejahtera is: I don’t know how to register. 
Your reason has been recorded. Your phone number is 019555555. KPM will contact you soon. Thank you.” (Marks 30)
